All the world is a melody.
What note are you?
Are you high, are you low?
Are you fast, are you slow?
Are you sour or in sweet harmony?

All the world is a melody
And the song needs all of me and all of you.
All the world is a tapestry, Im woven in with you
All the world is a restless sea, Im just a wave like you.
