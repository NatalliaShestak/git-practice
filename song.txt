All the world is a rainbow
What color are you?
Are you red, black, or white,
Are you yellow or brown,
Are you some other shade or hue?

All the world is a rainbow
And the sky needs all of me and all of you.
All of me, all of you
All our brothers and sisters too.
We can live, we can give
All of me and you.
